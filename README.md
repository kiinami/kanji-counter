# kanji-counter
This is a simple program that counts the number of kanji an user has learned so far depending on their Wanikani and displays it in a nice format.

## Usage

```bash
$ kanji-counter <data-file> <wanikani-level>
```
The first argument is the path to the data file. The second argument is the level of the user on WaniKani.

## Data file
The data file was obtained from [here](https://github.com/davidluzgouveia/kanji-data/blob/master/kanji-jouyou.json).
